`This website was created so that ministry partners and others
could find out what the Lord has been
doing through me as a full-time missionary. You can interact with
me and other members of my ministry team through prayer requests,
find details of my job as a computer programmer, read stories from
field ministry, view past prayer letters, and more!`,

`I have chosen the name \"Roots\" because me and my ministry partners
share much in common with a tree and it\'s roots. While only a certain
portion of a tree is above ground, many vital and life giving functions
take place beneath the ground in the roots. Without deep roots, a tree
would lose it's ability to stand and could no longer gather water, an
essential ingredient for life. Likewise, while I am the one that is called
the missionary, the work that is done in my ministry would not be possible
without the faithful men and women that support me through finances
and prayers. My desire is that this page is a testament to the
faithfulness of the Lord and those who have come alongside me as we
work together for the sake of the Gospel!`
